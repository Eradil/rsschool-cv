## About me

I started learning programming a few months ago and it seems to me that with due effort anyone can succeed in this area. For the coming years, my goal is to become a professional in my field.

As for strengths, I prefer to see things through to the end. I hope this quality will not let me down in learning programming.

As a result of the training, I made several projects that, in my opinion, are quite good for a beginner. And I want to believe that they will only get better.
